# Whisper-Tiny-German Fine-Tuning Project

## Overview
This mini project focuses on fine-tuning the Whisper-Tiny model using the German dataset from Common Voice 11. Due to computational limitations, I experimented with two variants of the model:

1. **Model V1 (100k Train Data):**
   - Trained for 3 hours
   - Achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) of 31% on the test dataset

2. **Model V2 (200k Train Data):**
   - Trained for 10 hours
   - Achieved a WER of 32% on the test dataset

## Model Availability
You can find the pre-trained models on Hugging Face:

- Whisper-Tiny-German V2 {https://huggingface.co/LiquAId/whisper-tiny-german-V2-HanNeurAI }

Feel free to explore and use these models for your own projects!
